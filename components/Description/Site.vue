        This site has being designed to learn a bit more about Nuxt 3. And help
        with demontrating the capabilities of Nuxt 3 and other technologies such as:
        <ul class="list-none list-outside text-white my-3">
          <li>Vue 3</li>
          <ul class="list-none list-outside ml-3">
            <li>Compisiton API</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Typescript</li>
          <li>TRPC</li>
          <ul class="list-none list-outside ml-3">
            <li>ZOD</li>
            <li>TanStack</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Day.js</li>
        </ul>
        Hopefully the structurer of the code will help fellow developers understand the additional value of some of these technologies. On top of that this project will result in something usefull for the employee that don't develop.
